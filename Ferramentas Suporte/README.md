## üß™ Troubleshooting & FAQ

Q: The script didn‚Äôt run with administrator rights?
A: For the tool to work properly, administrator rights are required.
Right-click the .bat file and choose "Run as administrator". This will ensure that both the Batch and PowerShell scripts run with the necessary privileges.
If nothing happens, check that User Account Control (UAC) is enabled and try again.

If you want to run the PowerShell script manually, use this command from an elevated PowerShell window:
```powershell
Start-Process powershell -Verb RunAs -ArgumentList "-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File 'Path\To\Windows_Maintenance_Tool.ps1'"
```
Q: Why does it crash when selecting registry cleanup?
A: This has been fully resolved in v3.1.3. The tool now safely lists and deletes registry keys using PowerShell.
Before any deletion, a backup is automatically created, and errors are properly handled to avoid script crashes or accidental data loss.

**Q: Why was Registry Defrag removed?**  
A: The feature depended on a third-party tool (NTREGOPT) which is no longer accessible.  
The script is now fully offline and native to Windows.
